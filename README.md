# Movie-Trailer

## Summary
A simple movie trailer website project for Udacity's full-stack nanodegree program. The project demonstrates the use of a Movie object class in Python to generate a static webpage, which displays a listing of favorite movies and links each movie to its trailers video on YouTube. The project also includes some CSS and jQuery involved in the display of the webpage.

## What's Included
Excluding this README.md file there are three python files:
  entertainment_center.py - The main entry to the program. Builds the movie list and calls the method to generate the web page.   
  fresh_tomatoes.py - The provided web page generator. It takes in a list of movies and builds the HTML and opens up your default browser to display the generated HTML page.
  media.py - Contains the class that provides the data structure to hold movie information.
